Background information

A versatile application must be created to enable optimal observations of the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, to enable proper exposures of the solar corona and of the "Diamond Ring" effect. For a full description of the phenomenon, with many links, see the http://web.williams.edu/Astronomy/IAU_eclipses/ for example. We are interested here in both the phase of totality, during which faint coronal structure can be observed, and in the 2nd and 3rd contacts - the times of the last solar visibility before totality, the the first visibility after totality. These two phases require different kinds of observation. The Megamovie project aims at assembling a large number of observations, by a large number of observers, to generate a highly oversampled database containing unique scientific information. These notes refer to what can be done with an unaided smartphone camera, assisted by the Megamovie app.

1. Totality. Here the objectives of the imagery are to capture as much of the spatial structure of the corona as possible, using a graded sequence of exposures that permit the widest possible contrast range: short exposures for the bright inner corona, and longer exposures for the fainter outer corona. The scientific applications of this imagery depends upon what actually happens in the corona during the ~90 minutes of totality. In addition to the corona, however, the gravitational deflection of starlight could be observable via the bright star Regulus, which fortuitously lies in the field of view. The stellar observation will require different optimal exposures.

2. The "diamond ring". During the last glimpse of the Sun, or the first glimpse, one peers through the last valley on the Moon that the observing geometry permits. A crescent of light rapidly diminishes at 2nd contact, typically with several bright points and then one final one; the bright points are "Baily's Beads" the overall effect constitudes the "Diamond Ring" effect.
